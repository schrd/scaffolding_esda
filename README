= scaffolding_esda - a more complete scaffolding extension for Ruby on Rails

The purpose of this extension is to provide an almost complete solution for
ordinary tables, for example a managing interface for master data. At Esda we
developed it for our inhouse ERP system.

= Quickstart

* install the gem
* add the gem in config/environment.rb to your application:

   config.gems "scaffolding_esda"

* use the scaffold method in your controller:

   class MyVeryOwnController
     scaffold :my_very_own_model
   end

* copy the assets from the public/ directory to your app or use you own
* implement a model named User that implements a has_any_privilege? method:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      def has_any_privilege?(privs)
        true
      end
    end
